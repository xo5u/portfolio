# Cybersecurity Mini-Portfolio
This repository contains two small security projects that I have completed.  
They are simple demonstrations to show my skills before starting the official graduation project.

## 1. Wireless Security Experiment
**Link:** https://github.com/xo5u/ESP_WIRELESS_HACKING

This project includes:
- Capturing WPA2 4-way handshake
- Testing password cracking in a controlled environment (home network)
- Creating an Evil Twin / Rogue Access Point for educational purposes
- Using ESP32 / hostapd / DNS spoofing
- All tests were done with permission and for academic learning only

**Goal:**  
To understand how Wi-Fi authentication works and how attacks can happen, in order to learn how to protect wireless networks.

## 2. Image Encryption & Steganography Tool
**Link:** https://github.com/xo5u/ENCRYPTION

This Python project hides text inside a grayscale image by changing pixel values.  
It uses:
- Dynamic shift based on password + SHA-256
- Random mapping table for characters
- Pixel-difference method to decrypt messages
- Simple integrity check to know if the image was changed

**Goal:**  
To practice Python, encryption ideas, and image processing.

## Purpose of This Repository
I created this combined portfolio so the supervisor can review my level, understand my interests, and decide if I am ready to start a graduation project related to cybersecurity or encryption.

## Ethical Notice
All wireless tests were done with permission.  
No real networks or users were harmed.  
The projects are for learning only.
